## Project Objective
This project is a personal homepage designed to showcase my professional background, technical skills, and past projects. Built with responsiveness and user experience in mind, it serves as an engaging portfolio for students, professionals, and potential collaborators. The website includes:
- A clean layout to navigate my accomplishments and contact details  
- A section for projects  
- An interactive **"Back to Top"** button  

## Creative Part
The project includes an interactive "Back to Top" button, designed to improve navigation by allowing users to quickly scroll back to the top of the page with a smooth scrolling effect. The button is styled to complement the website's minimalist design and only appears when the user scrolls down, ensuring it doesn't clutter the interface. I implemented this feature as the creative part of my project to enhance usability, showcase dynamic functionality using JavaScript, and add a polished, interactive element that improves the overall user experience.
